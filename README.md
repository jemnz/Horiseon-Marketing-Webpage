# Horiseon-Marketing-Webpage

## Description
I have refractored the marketing agency's website in order to make it more accessible. Increasing accesibility is important as it ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies and ensures the website is better positioned in search engines. It solves any furture litigation problems that may arise when people with disabilities cannot access their website. I've learnt the importance of website accessibility, using semantic html in oppose to non-semantic and importance of commenting code.

## Installation
The website can be opened in any browser via the following link: 
[Link to Deployed website] (https://jemnz.github.io/Horiseon-Marketing-Webpage/)

## Usage
Below is a screenshot of the deployed website which has links in the navigation bar to access different sections of the website.
